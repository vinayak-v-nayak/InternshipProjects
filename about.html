        <h3>Celebrating 20 years!</h3>
        <p >Since 2003</p>
        <p>Since its inception in 2003, Coffee Shops's Coffee
             has set out to show that its coffee is the best in the business. Founded by Vinayak, a pioneer in the coffee industry, 
             and owned and operated by New Orleans natives and brothers, Paul, Steven, and Scott Ballard since 2008, 
             the company has stuck true to that mission and its New Orleans roots.
              So why is Coffee Shop's Coffee better? Because its coffee comes from the top Arabica beans sourced from around the world,
               is made using superior roasting techniques in small batches and everyone at Coffee Shop's is passionate about the art of coffeemaking.</p>
